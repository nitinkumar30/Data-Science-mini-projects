# Aim

> You'll be able to understand why do we use Data Science & what it can do with the data.  
> Mainly it's used to process data into some meaningful series.  
> Usage of such modules and the effect they can create on data.  

# Your job

> Fork it for your knowledge as it's the basic level of tutorial on Data Science.  
> Star it to support my work.
